    <h2>Description</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
      From what I can tell, the secret behind Alton's lasagna is the addition of
      a little sugar to the sauce and using a bit more cheese than most other
      recipes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a few minor tweaks to his original recipe that I found
      necessary, for example adding a dash of wine vinegar to the sauce and
      changing the amount of Parmesan cheese.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>For the meat sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
      <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
      <li>
        1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)
      </li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 (28-ounce) can good-quality tomato</li>
      <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
      <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup sugar (to taste, optional)</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To assemble the lasagna:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)
      </li>
      <li>15 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds (24 ounces) mozzarella cheese, grated or sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 pound (4 ounces) freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <hr />
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a
        combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three
        kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.
        We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix
        of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
      </li>
      <li>
        From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of
        noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you
        have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
    </ol>
